My name is John, and I'm a senior software engineer at [Mercury](https://mercury.com/), a fintech company, where I mostly write Haskell. Before this I was an engineer at Facebook for 10 years, where I initially learned Haskell (writing rules in [Sigma](https://engineering.fb.com/2015/06/26/security/fighting-spam-with-haskell/), and then later leading a data-processing project that used Haskell at its core, but unfortunately didn't publish anything externally), but mostly wrote PHP and C++.

As I learn more Haskell, and use it in more and varied circumstances, I run into potentially interesting things and thought it made sense to start writing them down so that others may benefit.
